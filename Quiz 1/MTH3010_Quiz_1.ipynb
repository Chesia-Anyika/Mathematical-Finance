        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Adaptation**:\n",
        "The process $[Xt]$ is adapted to the filtration $[Σt]$. This means that $X_t​$ is measurable with respect to $Σ_t$ for each $t$.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrability**:\n",
        "$E(|X_t|)< \\infty$ for all $t \\geq 0$. This ensures that the expected value of the absolute value of $X_t$​ is finite.\n",

        "For all $s \\leq t$, $E(X_t|\\sum_s)$.\n",
        "In words, the conditional expectation of $X_t$ given the information available up to time ss (denoted as $\\sum_s$) is equal to $X_s$.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Role in modelling Stocks**\n",
        "1. **Information Efficiency:** The martingale property implies that at any given time $s$, the best predictor of the future stock price $X_t$ is the current price $X_s$. This reflects the idea that in an efficient market, stock prices adjust immediately to new information, and thus future changes are unpredictable based on current information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fair Pricing:** In financial markets, martingales play a crucial role in the pricing of derivative securities (options, futures, etc.). The absence of arbitrage opportunities in an idealized market suggests that the price of a derivative should be the expected value of its future payoff under the risk-neutral measure, discounted to the present.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stochastic Processes:** Stock prices are often modeled as martingales under certain assumptions about market efficiency and information flow. For instance, the geometric Brownian motion model (used in the Black-Scholes framework for option pricing) assumes that the logarithm of stock prices follows a Brownian motion, which is a type of martingale process.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Risk Management:** Martingales provide a foundation for risk management techniques such as hedging and portfolio management. Strategies like delta hedging aim to create portfolios that behave like martingales to minimize risk exposure to changes in stock prices."
