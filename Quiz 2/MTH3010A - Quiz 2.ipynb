    "1. Historical Method: Relies on actual past returns, which may not capture future volatility accurately.\n",
    "2. Parametric Method: Assumes returns are normally distributed, which might not always be true, but provides a theoretical approach.\n",

Historical and Monte Carlo methods might provide a more realistic view if returns are not normally distributed, while parametric methods are useful for theoretical models."
